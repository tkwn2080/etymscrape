This use is attested in English from 1851. In German from 1845 it was specifically contrasted toSemitic(Lassen). German philologist Max Müller (1823-1900) popularizedAryanin his writings on comparative linguistics, recommending it as the name (replacingIndo-European,Indo-Germanic,Caucasian,Japhetic) for the group of related, inflected languages connected with these peoples, mostly found in Europe but also including Sanskrit and Persian. The spellingArianwas used in this sense from 1839 (and is more philologically correct), but it caused confusion withArian, the term in ecclesiastical history. Aryanwas gradually replaced in comparative linguistics c. 1900 byIndo-European, except when used to distinguish Indo-European languages of India from non-Indo-European ones.

Many Indo-European languages show signs of once having distinguished the horizontal back of an animal (or a mountain range) from the upright back of a human.

In the U.S. Westbad manalso had a certain ambivalence: [N.B.] Persian hasbadin more or less the same sense as the English word, but this is regarded by linguists as a coincidence. The forms of the words diverge as they are traced back in time (Persianbadcomes from Middle Persianvat), and such accidental convergences exist across many languages, given the vast number of words in each and the limited range of sounds humans can make to signify them. Among other coincidental matches with English are Koreanmani\"many,\" Chinesepei\"pay,\" Nahuatl (Aztecan)huel\"well,\" Mayahol\"hole.\""

OED rejects connection to other Germanic words for \"bellows, belly\" as without evidence and finds a Celtic origin untenable. In some senses perhaps from Old Frenchbague, which is also from Germanic. As disparaging slang for \"woman\" it dates from 1924 in modern use (but various specialized senses of this are much older, and comparebaggage). The meaning \"person's area of interest or expertise\" is by 1964, from African-American vernacular, from jazz sense of \"category,\" probably via notion of putting something in a bag. The meaning \"fold of loose skin under the eye\" is by 1867. Related:bags. To beleft holding the bag(and presumably nothing else), \"cheated, swindled\" is attested by 1793. Many figurative senses, such as the verb meaning \"to kill game\" (1814) and its colloquial extension to \"catch, seize, steal\" (1818) are from the notion of thegame bag(late 15c.) into which the product of the hunt was placed. This also probably explains modern slangin the bag\"assured, certain\" (1922, American English). Tolet the cat out of the bag\"reveal the secret\" is from 1760. The source is probably the French expressionAcheter chat en poche\"buy a cat in a bag,\" which is attested in 18c. French and explained in Bailey's \"Universal Etymological English Dictionary\" (1736), under the entry forTo buy a pig in a pokeas \"to buy a Thing without looking at it, or enquiring into the Value of it.\" (Similar expressions are found in Italian and German; and in English, Wycliffe (late 14c.) hasTo bye a catte in þo sakke is bot litel charge).

The earliest form looks like \"bare neck,\" and one of the Middle English synonyms for the bird wasballed cote, but this resemblance might be folk etymology. The word is often said to be from a Celtic source (compare Bretonbernik, a kind of shellfish), but the application to the goose predates that to the shellfish, and the word seems to have arisen in English. The goose nests in the Arctic in summer and returns to Europe in the winter, hence the mystery surrounding its reproduction. It was believed in ancient superstition (and as recently as late 17c.) to hatch or develop from the barnacle's shell, possibly because the crustacean's feathery stalks resemble goose down. Some versions of the fable had the barnacles growing on trees and dropping into the sea to become geese.

Roger Lass (\"Old English\") describes the verb as \"a collection of semantically related paradigm fragments,\" while Weekley calls it \"an accidental conglomeration from the different Old English dial[ect]s.\" It is the most irregular verb in Modern English and the most common. Collective in all Germanic languages, it has eight different forms in Modern English:BE(infinitive, subjunctive, imperative);AM(present 1st person singular);ARE(present 2nd person singular and all plural);IS(present 3rd person singular);WAS(past 1st and 3rd persons singular);WERE(past 2nd person singular, all plural; subjunctive);BEING(progressive & present participle; gerund);BEEN(perfect participle).

The \"b-root\" had no past tense in Old English, but often served as future tense ofam/was. In 13c. it took the place of the infinitive, participle and imperative forms ofam/was. Later its plural forms (we beth, ye ben, they be) became standard in Middle English and it made inroads into the singular (I be, thou beest, he beth), but forms ofareclaimed this turf in the 1500s and replacedbein the plural.

The earliest French use of the word is as the name of a people apparently in southern Gaul, which led to the theory, now considered doubtful on phonetic grounds, that the word comes fromVisigothus. The typical use in Old French seems to have been as a derogatory nickname for Normans, leading to another theory (not universally accepted) that traces it to the Normans' (alleged) frequent use of the Germanic oathbi God. OED dismisses in a three-exclamation-mark fury one fanciful version of the \"by god\" theory as \"absurdly incongruous with facts.\" At the end, not much is left standing except Spanishbigote\"mustache,\" which also has been proposed as the origin of the word, but not explained, so the chief virtue of that theory is the lack of evidence against it. In support of the \"by God\" theory the surnamesBigott,Bygottare attested in Normandy and in England from the 11c., and French name-etymology sources (such as Dauzat) explain it as a derogatory name applied by the French to the Normans and representing \"by god.\" The English were known asgoddamns200 years later in Joan of Arc's France, and during World War I Americans serving in France were said to be known asles sommobiches(seeson of a bitch) for their characteristic oaths.

There seems to have been an avoidance in Germanic, perhaps from taboo, of other PIE words for \"blood,\" such as*esen-(source of poetic Greekear, Old Latinaser, Sanskritasrk, Hittiteeshar); also*krew-, which seems to have had a sense of \"blood outside the body, gore from a wound\" (source of Latincruour\"blood from a wound,\" Greekkreas\"meat\"), but which came to mean simply \"blood\" in the Balto-Slavic group and some other languages. Inheritance and relationship senses (also found in Latinsanguis, Greekhaima) emerged in English by mid-13c. The meanings \"person of one's family, race, kindred; offspring, one who inherits the blood of another\" are late 14c.

Partridge reports thatbloodywas \"respectable\" before c. 1750, and it was used by Dryden, Fielding and Swift, but it was heavily tabooed c. 1750-c. 1920.

Rhetorically or figuratively it was the common type of hardness, durability, or obduracy since late 14c. The meaning \"effrontery, impudence, excessive assurance\" is from 1620s. The slang sense of \"high officials\" is first recorded 1899, from their insignia. The meaning \"brass musical instruments of a band\" is from 1832."

    "response": "common name of any lepidopterous insect active in daylight, Old Englishbuttorfleoge, evidentlybutter(n.) +fly(n.), but the name is of obscure signification. Perhaps based on the old notion that the insects (or, according to Grimm, witches disguised as butterflies) consume butter or milk that is left uncovered. Or, less creatively, simply because the pale yellow color of many species' wings suggests the color of butter. Another theory connects it to the color of the insect's excrement, based on Dutch cognateboterschijte. Also seepapillon. Applied to persons from c. 1600, originally in reference to vain and gaudy attire; by 1806 in reference to transformation from early lowly state; in reference to flitting tendencies by 1873.

Possibly a shortened fromcapitulare\"headdress,\" from Latincaput\"head\" (from PIE root*kaput-\"head\"). The Late Latin word apparently originally meant \"a woman's head-covering,\" but the sense was transferred to \"hood of a cloak,\" then to \"cloak\" itself, though the various senses co-existed. Old English took in two forms of the Late Latin word, one meaning \"head-covering,\" the other \"ecclesiastical dress\" (seecape(n.1)). In most Romance languages, a diminutive of Late Latincappahas become the usual word for \"head-covering\" (such as Frenchchapeau). The meaning \"soft, small, close-fitted head covering\" in English is from early 13c., originally for women; extended to men late 14c.; extended to cap-like coverings on the ends of anything (as inhubcap) from mid-15c. The meaning \"contraceptive device\" is by 1916. The meaning \"cap-shaped piece of copper lined with gunpowder and used to ignite a firearm\" is by 1825, hencecap-gun(1855); extended to paper strips used in toy pistols by 1872 (cap-pistolis from 1879). Figurativethinking capis from 1839 (considering capis 1650s).Cap and bells(1781) was the insignia of a fool;cap and gown(1732) of a scholar. Toset one's cap atorfor(1773) means \"use measures to gain the regard or affection of,\" usually in reference to a woman seeking a man's courtship."

    "response": "c. 1600, in music, \"involving tones foreign to the normal tonality of the scale, not diatonic,\" from Latinchromaticus, from Greekkhrōmatikos\"relating to color, suited for color\" (also used in reference to music), fromkhrōma(genitivekhrōmatos) \"color, complexion, character\" (but chiefly used metaphorically of embellishments in music), originally \"skin, surface\" (seechroma). Greek also usedkhrōmafor certain modifications of the usual diatonic music scale. The reason the Greeks used this word in music is not now entirely clear. Perhaps the connection is the extended sense ofkhrōma, \"ornaments, makeup, embellishments,\" via the notion of \"characteristic\" of a musical scale or speech. In English, the musical sense of \"progressing by half-tones, involving the sharps and flats of the staff\" is by 1881. Meaning \"of or pertaining to color\" is from 1829."
